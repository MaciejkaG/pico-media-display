# Pico Media Display
NOTE: It's designed to use on a Raspberry Pi Pico running MicroPython with an I2C 16x2 LCD.<br>
Basically the ``sendInfo.py`` file is supposed to run on the PC connected through USB to a Pico running ``pico.py`` script (but it should be named ``main.py`` in order to run automatically on Pico's startup).
